Here there are all files of this project

## Getting Started
S&S is our new Startup created to analyze and improve the company's managment and keeping customer's benefit optimal.
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

- OS Android (from 4.1), iOS or Windows, (we need to run some tests! This is an estimation)
- A browser or ours app,
- An Internet connection,
- GPS location,

(What things you need to install the software and how to install them)

```


```

### Installing


A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

We will develop an automated system for running tests

It's important to test API calls and correct insert of data

Test a connection to DB (a correct response returns code 204)
```
curl http://sandsloadbalancer-620921771.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com/ping
```

## Deployment

We will write a guide and publish the files needed and where to save them
